# Chapter 13

_Favour and loss of it both disturb us._

_Rank and body are both a problem._

What’s meant by ‘favour and loss of it both disturb us’?

Favour disturbs the subject when it’s given

As much as it does when it’s taken away.

That’s what’s meant by ‘favour and loss of it both disturb us’.

What’s meant by ‘rank and body are both a problem’?

I’ve problems because I have a body.

When I’ve no body where’s my problem?

Who values the body even more than the empire,

Can be trusted with the empire.

Who loves the body even more than the empire,

Can be a custodian of the empire.
