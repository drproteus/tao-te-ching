# Chapter 2

The world knows beauty as beauty,

So there is then ugliness.

The world knows good as good,

So there is then the bad.

_As is and is-not create each other,_

_The hard and easy define each other,_

_The long and short delimit each other,_

_The high and low depend on each other,_

_Voice and music harmonise with each other,_

_Last and next follow each other._

So the wise adhere to action through non-action,

And communicate the teaching without words.

_From the Way come the myriad creatures_

_Yet it imposes no authority._

_It gives them life without possession._

_It benefits them but asks no thanks._

_It does its work but claims no merit._

_Because it claims no merit_

_Merit is never lacking in it._
