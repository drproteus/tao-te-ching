# Chapter 10

Carrying your spiritual body on your head

Can you embrace the One and not let go?

Concentrating the breath

Can you become supple as a child?

Can you polish the mysterious mirror

And leave no mark?

Can you love the people and rule the state

Without indulging in action?

When the gates of heaven open and close,

Can you keep to the female role?

When your mind penetrates the four directions

Are you able to know nothing?

_It gives them life and nurtures._

_It gives them life without possession._

_It benefits them but asks no thanks._

_It holds but imposes no authority._

Such is the mysterious virtue.
