# Chapter 11

_Thirty spokes_

_Round one hub._

Employ the nothing inside

And you can use a cart.

Knead the clay to make a pot.

Employ the nothing inside

And you can use a pot.

Cut out doors and windows.

Employ the nothing inside

And you can use a room.

What is achieved is something,

By employing nothing it can be used.
