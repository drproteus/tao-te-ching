# Chapter 8

The highest virtue is like water.

Since water helps the myriad creatures,

And settles, without contention,

Where no one wishes to live,

It is near to the Way.

_In a house position matters._

_In mental quality depth matters._

_In friends kindness matters._

_In speaking honesty matters._

_In government order matters._

_In transactions ability matters._

_In actions promptness matters._

By not contending it never errs.
