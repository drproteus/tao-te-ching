# Chapter 5

Heaven and earth are ruthless,

Trampling the myriad creatures like straw dogs.

The wise are ruthless,

Considering the people as straw dogs.

The space between earth and heaven,

Isn’t it like a bellows?

_It’s empty but never exhausted._

_The more it works the more flows out._

_Much speech leads in the end to silence._

_Better to hold fast to the Void._
