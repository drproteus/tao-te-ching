# Chapter 9

Rather than filling it overfull

Better to stop in time.

Sharpen it to a point

The edge wonâ€™t last forever.

Gold and jade may fill the house

But no one can retain them.

Boasting of wealth and virtue,

Brings trouble on oneself.

Reticence when the job is done,

Is the Way of heaven.
