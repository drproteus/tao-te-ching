# Chapter 3

Don’t give honours to the worthy,

Protect people from ambition.

Don’t value scarce things,

Protect the people from envy.

Don’t show what’s desired,

Keep people from temptation.

So, in governing, the wise

Empty the mind

But fill the stomach,

Weaken ambition

But strengthen the bones,

Keep things free of

Desire and learning,

So the clever take no action.

Act without taking action

And things will be in order.
